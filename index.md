# What is mongo2neo4j?

Imports object relations generated by Object Relation Mappers (ORMs) like [Mongoose](https://mongoosejs.com/) and stored in [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/) into the graph database management system [Neo4j](https://neo4j.com/) for exploration with the no-code graphical querying tool [SemSpect](https://www.semspect.de/). Further relations between objects can be specified via options.

# What for?

Imagine you just released your latest MEAN-stack app and want to learn how it is used. You could write some MongoDB queries to find out _"how many users of the free tier are at all producing some data?", "which feature is used most by subscribers?",_ ... But maybe you never find time to write those queries or you do not know exact what to look for. A graphical large-data exploration tool like SemSpect comes in handy, which allows you to discover patterns in your data by simple navigation.

As SemSpect is layered on top of the graph database system Neo4j as graph app, your MongoDB data needs first to be established in Neo4j. This can be easily achieved using the mongo2neo4j tool.


# How does it work?

The mongodb2neo4j script creates for each collection in the given MongoDB a label (class of nodes having) in Neo4j and adds a node in Neo4j for each of its documents. Cross-references between MongoDB documents using unique `ObjectId` identifiers are turned into Neo4j relations, nicely rendered by SemSpect.

# Installation

## Install Neo4j

The free Neo4j Desktop works well (see [Neo4j](https://neo4j.com/))

## Install SemSpect Plugin

The free SemSpect Graph App for Neo4j works well (see [SemSpect](https://www.semspect.de/))

## Install Python libs

```sh
% pip install mongo2neo4j
```

# Run the importer

You can run the `mongo2neo4j`importer from the shell by providing at least the name of the MongoDB the data should be imported from. If not specified the default `neo4j` DB is targeted with the default `neo4j` user. It is likely that you will have to add passwords.

```sh
% mongo2neo4j \
  [--mongo_host mongodb://<mongo_user>:<mongo_password>@<mongo_host>] \
  [--neo4j_user=<neo4j_user>] [--neo4j_password=<neo4j_password>] \
  <mongo_db>
```

Further configuration options are listed on calling

```sh
% mongo2neo4j -h
```

See [Script Arguments](https://github.com/MAKOMO/mongo2neo4j/wiki/Script-Arguments) for the full list of available arguments.


NOTE: *if the [APOC plugin](https://neo4j.com/docs/apoc/) is installed in the Neo4j DB, the faster and memory-effective `apoc.periodic.iterate` method is used to generate nodes and sublabels.*
